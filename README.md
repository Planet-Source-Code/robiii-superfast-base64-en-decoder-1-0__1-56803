## Superfast Base64 En/Decoder 1\.0


</div>

### Description

This zipfile contains the sourcecode for an ActiveX DLL wich can be used to en/decode base64 data. This data can be strings or files. The object is one of the fastest (VB) variations around and thoroughly tested.

The zipfile also contains a sample application wich demonstrates the use of the object and also the object's documentation in PDF format. It is completely free to use, just make sure you mention my name somewhere and drop me an email!
 
### More Info
 
The user does need to have MSXML 3.0 or higher to be installed on the system. The object will handle it when this is not the case and return a neat error (rather than just crashing)

No side-effects known
